# Oscura Informed

Fey's theme features meticulously curated accent colors and precisely balanced contrast, crafting a sophisticated coding environment that's both elegant and easy on the eyes.

## Recommended Settings and extension

For the best experience, we recommend using these settings in the cursor's settings.json:

```json
{
    "editor.fontFamily": "'SF Mono', 'Fira Code'",
    "editor.fontSize": 12,
    "editor.lineHeight": 1.6
}
```

For proper syntax highlighting of styled-components, we recommend installing the [vscode-styled-components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=styled-components.vscode-styled-components) extension.
